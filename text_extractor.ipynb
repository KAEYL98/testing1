      "transactions, and product centricity, have shifted to a customer-centric strategy in which the\n",
      "customer is a valued asset of the organization. According to Heldt et al. [ 9], companies have\n",
      "become more customer-centric, with the inclusion of a customer perspective in the analysis\n",
      "of anticipated revenues, which were formerly forecasted primarily based on expected\n",
      "product sales. Regardless of the importance of this new customer-oriented strategy, the\n",
      "product adaptability perspective should not be disregarded. Even when a customer-centric\n",
      "approach is critical, businesses require their products to fulﬁl consumers’ needs. Most\n",
      "managers want to analyze and make decisions based on both product (and brand) and\n",
      "consumer perceptions [9].\n",
      "According to [ 10], both points of view are critical because branded products are\n",
      "marketed to customers and those customers purchase them. This means that combining\n",
      "product and customer evaluations would produce better results than conducting the two\n",
      "analyses separately.\n",
      "Add-on selling is another important product-based strategy commonly used by\n",
      "businesses to maximize customer equity. Sales are boosted through the provision of\n",
      "additional items or product categories to customers and through providing more highly\n",
      "priced (enhanced) products or a greater supply of the same product; this common\n",
      "practice helps to increase customer spending [ 11]. This is especially important for multi-\n",

      "firm’s website. They become more loyal to the company and boost their spending and\n",
      "CLV proportionately. Switching costs are significant when customers buy different\n",
      "products from an online retailer selling multiple product categories [ 12]. Customers\n",
      "may be less likely to visit other retailers, especially when they find everything they are\n",
      "looking for on one website [12].\n",
      "Businesses must understand the quality of their customers, which best explains why\n",
      "one is more valuable than the other. According to [ 13], this condition can be inﬂuenced by\n",
      "several circumstances. The three variables considered are worth examining—the extent to\n",
      "which consumers make cross-purchases, time between transactions, and number of product\n",
      "returns. The number of distinct product categories that customers purchase indicates the\n",
      "degree of cross-buying, which is an important aspect for CLV prediction. As proof, Reinartz\n",
      "et al. [ 14] found that customers shopping within only one category have a lower CLV\n",
      "compared to multi-category shoppers. In addition, a study of catalogue retailers found\n",
      "that customers increased their CLV by an average of 5% for each add-on product category\n",
      "they purchased.\n",
      "This is also a crucial metric for determining a customer’s worth, as purchasing a wide\n",
      "range of products from the same company demonstrates loyalty, and loyal customers spend\n",
      "more during their lifetime according to [12].\n",
      "Consequently, we hypothesize that distinct product category (DPC) is a signiﬁcant\n",
      "element in determining which customers are the most valuable and should also be predicted\n",
      "as an additional output while predicting CLV .\n",
      "Separately, it was noted in [ 13] that there is an inverted U-shape in the effect of\n",
      "time between purchases on the longevity of earnings. Customers with a moderate but\n",
      "steady inter-purchase time between consecutive purchases may have a longer period of\n",
      "proﬁtability than other customers.\n",
      "In this study, we also consider inter-purchase times and calculate the trend in amount\n",

      "how customers’ transaction trends evolve.\n",
      "Although considering information on the product category sold and the trends re-\n",
      "garding the amount spent with each subsequent transaction are signiﬁcant practices when\n",
      "determining high-value consumers, many CLV-related studies have failed to consider these\n",
      "factors [ 11]. As a novel approach, we created these two features as additional output\n",
